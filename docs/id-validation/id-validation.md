# ID Validation

Identity verification is integral to payment processing, often necessitating verified accounts for the provision of online services. To simplify this for our merchants, we've developed a service tailored to streamline compliance with these verification requirements.

Moreover, we've seamlessly integrated this service into the payment workflow and provided a dedicated API endpoint. This endpoint facilitates independent validations, separate from payment transactions, serving versatile purposes such as pre-validating documents to boost conversion rates or confirming the identity of account holders.

In order to use the ID validation endpoint it is necessary to have a specific contract id of the type "id validation".
